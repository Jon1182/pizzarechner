## Dev notes

- Recommended VS Code extensions: **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** and **Prettier**.

- If your editor shows "Unknown at rule @tailwind", enable the Tailwind extension and/or add workspace settings (a `.vscode/settings.json` is included) that ignore unknown at-rules and point IntelliSense to `tailwind.config.js`.
